Glider is a special airplane without engines.

I enjoy making all kinds of paper planes that fly as gliders. Wright Brothers gained piloting experience flying gliders. The serenity of silent flying is truly rewarding for all, young and old. This inspired me to create my beautiful Sunshine Glider.

Soaring through the air in a glider with meditative silence is refreshing and exciting. Flying in Sunshine Glider high above the earth is an exhilarating experience. Sunshine Glider is colorful, bright and trendy and will be an exciting addition to Lego community.
